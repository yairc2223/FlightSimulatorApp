# FlightSimulatorApp
Updated 1 minute ago  This is a Flight Simulator app, designed using WPF, written in C#. MVVM was chosen as the software architecture pattern here in order to fully facilitate the separation between the design and logic. The project's GUI includes a Joystick that controls the plane by sending commands to the simulator( fully animated by me), a Bing map including an updating pin located by our simulator's latitude and longitude and of course a throttle. The GUI allows comfortable interface and detailed live data from the plane. The logic layer constantly sending commands and getting data from the plane using multithreading. it is required to have .NET Framework 4 and windows 1p installed on your device in order to successfully run this app.
